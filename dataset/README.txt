The data used for this experiment is yet to be disclosed. And will be available under the name "dehorning_annotated_original_dataset.csv".
The format expected in the dataset is as follows:

calf_id	 DateTime	                  Accx	      Accy	      Accz	           behaviour	        behaviour_seq_id
 1306	2022-02-24 00:08:34.402385	0.812500	0.390625	0.281250	oral manipulation of pen	       0
 1306	2022-02-24 00:08:34.441385	0.687500	0.375000	0.375000	oral manipulation of pen	       0

 behaviour_seq_id represents a behaviour segment as the data is expressed per unit time (25Hz).
